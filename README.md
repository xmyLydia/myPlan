# myPlan
A plan project. People can write down their ideas and place them here, it could be some small plan but not sure which one to start first, or it can be some travel plan with friends.
Docker makes it easier to deploy and run. Front-end use react, redux-form, scss. Backend uses Spring MVC, rest API, swagger is used to demonstrate APIs, storybook is used for UI.
